It's time to make a game! goal of this project is to learn how to use TDD.

NOTES:
-Fix placing ships in illegal position
(Randomizer also breaks if it tries to put ship in wrong place multiple times)

NOTE: There was a problem: Enemy's randomized movements doesn't for some reason recognize player's board, unless
the ships are pre-rendered.
But now somehow it fixed itself? There's a mystery. I didn't even restart live server (in case it or npx or something gets tired
after hours and starts lagging.)
